# Minsynth
"Min synth" is a small software synth intended for integration into other projects.
The name is swedish and means "my synth", but it could also mean "minimal (or minimum) synth" (works in english too).

## Current features

 * A few basic oscilator 
 * envelopes
 * arpegiators

## Planned features

 * integer based

 * simple effects like reverb, delay and bitcrusher
   inspiration: https://github.com/ElectroSmash/pedal-pi
 * look into borrowing/copying features supported by https://github.com/mbitsnbites/soundbox
 * play samples, perhaps as a instrument
 * soundfonts
 * possible nyquist plugins
 * basic general audio input, so you can connect a guitar and play
 * perhaps create a fake buzz interface to use the open source [buzz machines](https://github.com/Buzztrax/buzzmachines)
