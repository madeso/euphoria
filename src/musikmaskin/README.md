"Musik maskin" is a music making application.
The name is swedish for "music machine".

** Current features **

 * play sound from either keyboard or midi input, choose the oscilator type, envelope and master sound in a basic "dear imgui" based gui.


** Planned features **

 * configurable midi input
 * piano roll, with ability to only display notes in a certain scale [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZeZ75gM9p4) [bosca ceoil](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/boscaceoil/) and "chord notes"
 * basic tracker/table like note placing functionality
 * place pattern in a gui like fl studio/dance ejay, should be many shortcuts so there is less drag and drop though
 * node based genereator/effect connection [like](http://jeskola.net/buzz/) [buzz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77zg3fJyaH0)
 * custom piano roll like [hydrogen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwR1KbX6MZg) with simple pattern generator like fl studio
 * replace minsynth with something more battle tested like https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth
 * possible weird instruments like gamepads and a arduino+usbhost shield+rockband keytar input thingy (because I have a rockband keytar already)
 * music generation code
