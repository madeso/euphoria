# Icon design

The icon is based around the letter E. The F part of the E is made to look like the google chrome crash dino or pacman eating a candy. The candy comes from one of the buttons on a NES controller. The stylized F with a long base and a racer stripe at the top turns in to a negative mirrored E as well.

# Logo design

The logo is the Icon and the text euphoria in 'fira code' light. The lowercase i is reshaped to look like a atari styled controller.
