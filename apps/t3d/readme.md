* asset placer [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNqc_zMehAI) and [documentation](https://cookiebadger.github.io/assetplacer-docs/index.html)

## todo
* should we force items on a grid or not
* te
* duplicate selected item
* delete selected item
* box selection
* complete lister implementation
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEzCy0c3gEU
* continous collision when placing items
* functionality so roate multiple can consider global/local pivot
* arrays
* snap to 3d splines:
    > This right here is the future. Bendable, rotatable, morphable 'grids'. Snap anything to anywhere. Precise measurements. Edit quickly, even after content is complete.

* random placement on quad
* rotator tool with protractor thing from sketchup
* replace with matching mesh
* quickly switch between old snaps (switching between 1 and 3 for example)
* iterate selection when raycast return many
* update grid

* see measurement directly for selected item, sketchup like
* multiple 3d windows
* cordon view/occulsion box - boxes to hide everything outside boxes (also in game) - (hammer)
* keys to rotate object around xyz with fixed increments
* hotkeys to toggle snapp
* alt key to temporarily toggle snap
* prefabs/pack ins (meshes, entities + lights)
    * https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/NathanCheever/20180618/320112/A_Prefab_Primer.php
    * dynamic prefabs? handle scaling with winforms like anchor points
    * create prefab, sketchup style(component), share prefab between levels
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AeUyNaWb58
* grid paint
* smart paint/wave function collapse to a grid
* plug/socket system, 2 mesh types that go together, can be from different kits as long as they match, square plugs, circle plugs etc...
  create for transition blocks or wall/destruction
* add decals for rust, mold and cracks
* mouse wheel swap (ctrl+scroll?)
* photoshop like layers
* prop kit => asset forge?

## todo (require better renderer)
* proper rendering of current selection
