# Locate SDL3 library
# This module defines
# SDL3_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
# SDL3_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL3
# SDL3_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
#
# This module responds to the the flag:
# SDL3_BUILDING_LIBRARY
# If this is defined, then no SDL3main will be linked in because
# only applications need main().
# Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
# module will attempt to locate and set the the proper link flags
# as part of the returned SDL3_LIBRARY variable.
#
# Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the
# OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to -lSDL3main which
# this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
# module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.
#
#
# Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL3_LIBRARY_TEMP in your configuration
# and no SDL3_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL3 library
# (SDL3.dll, libsdl3.so, SDL3.framework, etc).
# Set SDL3_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL3 library, and configure again.
# Similarly, if you see an empty SDL3MAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value
# as appropriate. These values are used to generate the final SDL3_LIBRARY
# variable, but when these values are unset, SDL3_LIBRARY does not get created.
#
#
# $SDL3DIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDL3DIR
# used in building SDL3.
# l.e.galup  9-20-02
#
# Modified by Eric Wing.
# Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables
# and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior.
# Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
# Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL guidelines.
# Added a search for SDL3main which is needed by some platforms.
# Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms.
# Added needed compile switches for MinGW.
#
# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of
# SDL3_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the CMake environment
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.
#
# Note that the header path has changed from SDL3/SDL.h to just SDL.h
# This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention
# is #include "SDL.h", not <SDL3/SDL.h>. This is done for portability
# reasons because not all systems place things in SDL3/ (see FreeBSD).
