music
=====

This is a basic software synth, intended for integration into other projects, but it should be able to be run standalone as well.

I also need to come up with a better name than music. I'm partial to 'Bosca Box' since this project is in part inspired by 'Bosca Ceoil' and 'Pan', the greek music god that lost a music contest to the better musician(and god) Apollo.

Features:
=========

 * play sound on keyboard input

Planned features:
=================

 * better software synth with more features
 * load instruments from file
 * configurable midi input
 * basic tracker/piano roll/pattern gui
 * basic general audio input, so you can connect a guitar
 * simple effects like reverb, delay and bitcrusher
 * possible nyquist plugins
 * possible weird instruments like gamepads and a arduino+usbhost shield+rockband keytar input thingy (because I have a rockband keytar already)
